# Etch-A-Sketch
This is a basic etch-a-sketch program that I made on accident one day when messing around with the turtle module. 
To use this program to the best of its abilities, here are the command keys:
The background color will start off white and the turtle will start off as black. To change this press
the space bar = black screen, h = white screen, g = green turtle, p = pink turtle, b = black turtle, y = yellow turtle, o = orange turtle, r = red turtle, u = purple turtle, w = white turtle, and press e = blue turtle.
